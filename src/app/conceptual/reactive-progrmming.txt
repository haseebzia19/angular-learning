Reactive programming is programming model
Reactive programming is a way of writing code that allow developers to express the 
flow of data through application in more declarative way

In angular, reactive programing is used to manage and manuplate data in real time.
angular use RxJS (fundamental part of angular) 3rd party library which provide set of tools and operators for
building reactive application.

In angular, most common use of angular is managing form. reactive forms provide a way
to manage complex form input, validation and data synchronization.

angular change detection system is also build around reactive programming.
when data changes, angular update view(html) to reflect those changes.
these changes are done using observable and operators to ensure that changes
are made without unnecessary rendering.
